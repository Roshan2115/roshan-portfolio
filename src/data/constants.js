Users can use hand gestures to explain and elaborate on anything simply by waving their hands in the air, which will be reflected on a display. This creates an interactive interface between the user and the system. It is beneficial for senior citizens, children, deaf individuals, and can be applied in the education field. It will run on PCs using a webcam in desktop mode.",
